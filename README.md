Dentry is a simple commmand-line tool intended to
help with data entry. I created something like this
long ago in the form of an extremely simple Python
script that I used while grading exams (I was a teacher),
the point of it being to save me the time of searching
a spreadsheet for the student's name by scanning over
it with my eyes. I have abstracted the idea to make
it as broadly useful as possible while maintaining the
simplicity of use.

This project is still under construction.
