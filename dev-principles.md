# Dev Principles

* program against interfaces;
* use dependency injection for inversion of control;
* when possible, program for what you want (semantically), not how you want to do it (procedurally);
* extract interface copy (Strings) into configuration files;
* do not add excessive complexity for the sake of future expandability;
* keep the interface simple and free of surprises;
